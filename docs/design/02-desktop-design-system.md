# 02. Desktop design system

Conventions for the Electron desktop app (`apps/desktop`). Read this before
adding a component, overlay, or style. The rule of thumb: **one source per
concern, tokens over literals, flat over boxed.** If you reach for a raw color,
a one-off shadow, a bespoke button, or a hardcoded `px-*` on a control — stop,
there's already a primitive for it.
